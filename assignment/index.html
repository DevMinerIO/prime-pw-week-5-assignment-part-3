    <ul>
      <li>(in function "addToCollection"Am I able to see the .title, .artist, and .yearPublished 
        because they are in the array im looking at? They were made as. local variables in my "addToCollection" function.
      </li>
      <li>In the "addToCollection function I tried using the same parameter names as the object variables.
        However I could not get it to work even when using this.artist, this.title and this.yearPublished.
        Can you please show how it is done correctly? (if possible)
